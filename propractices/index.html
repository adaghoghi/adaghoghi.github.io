	<br>
	<center><p>My name is Alvand Daghoghi, and I’m currently a senior at NYU Tandon School of Engineering studying Integrated Digital Media (IDM). <br> Over the past year, I’ve taken classes in digital photography and I’m slowly transitioning into film photography. <br> My major is diverse in the design/media world, I’ve taken classes in web design, sound design/music production, graphic design, etc. <br> With that background, I moved into film production, working as a production designer. 
<br>
Production design has taught me a lot about how to create, manipulate, and compose. <br> Whether that’s a fancy penthouse in soho, or the interior of a suburban home. <br> Working as a production designer changed the way I view photography. <br> I became much more understanding of the use of space, and how very little can affect so much in just a simple shot/frame. <br> It has also taught me how to navigate as a professional. <br> A production will always be a chaotic balance of casual/friendly and professional/diligent. 
<br>
I’ve spent some time over the past year getting into, and now, experimenting with photography. I’ve made a few photo series, one of which called Ridgewood? is uploaded on medium.com. I’ve been trying to make it a habit to carry my camera with me at all times, even if I never take it out of my bag, having access to it allows me to ground myself in my work. 
<br>
On top of my work in film and photography, I am the head of Public Relations for Delta Kappa Alpha, which is a cinematic fraternity at NYU. I’ve been directly in charge of the website for over a year, as my previous position was webmaster, and assist in planning and executing recruitment and various events around campus. </p></center>
