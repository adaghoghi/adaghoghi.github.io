	<center><p>I started doing the 20 Projects in 20 Minutes and then by the 8 minute mark, <br> I came up with my football zine idea. <br> I didn't feel the need to continue the exercise because this idea pretty much included everything that I wanted to work on, <br> with a subject I wanted to work in.</p></center>

	<br>
	<p class="page-wrap">I’m doing a football zine and I have a rough idea of what I want to do but I’m still figuring out the ‘kinks’. <br> I know I want to have something in there, or maybe the project is based around, the concept of the military and war and how all of that interplays. <br> Maybe I can do a sort of rule book, that could be interesting and I can play into it by having it be spiral bound.
<br>
<br>
I didn’t watch the super bowl or really see anything about it, I should look into that a little bit. <br> I saw another white guy retire early, and I want to potentially talk about how that’s possible due to the socio-economic status of them and the privilege they possess as white men. <br> I can talk about how white parents are putting their kids into football programs less and less.
<br>
<br>
I think it would be good to emphasize the youth, at least at some point. <br> I don’t know or think there has been any study on the brains of children who play pee wee football or pop warner or anything. <br> I could look into that. <br> I also want to talk to youth coaches, other football coaches, college and high school football players. <br> I can do profiles on one of them, maybe some, build a relationship with one of them. <br> Take a photo, have a whole page in my zine dedicated to them.
<br>
<br>
I should do more research on zines in general, see examples and inspiration I can take from. <br> This is in terms of format and also content. <br> I should explore different ways to print or make these zines, and the cost that that would include. <br> If I want to mass-print them, and by mass I only mean like 100-200 something like that. Kickstarter?
<br>
<br>
Football documentaries can also be something to look into (Aaron Hernandez is an example).</p>

	<br>
	<p class="page-wrap">I need to have more of a perspective from the pro-football side of things. <br> That’s why I wanted to watch this TED talk from Angus Reid, <i>Why We Need High School Football.</i> <br> He mentions that he is explicitly in favor of high school football, not youth, or professional. <br> Football, especially high school football, in his words, allows you to learn to set goals for yourself, how to win and how to lose, how to handle pressure, summarizing into, ‘qualities that make you a productive adult.’ 
<br>
<br>
A major point for him is that football gives structure in the lives of those playing it. <br> You know you have one game a week in the six-month season, and that you have practice every day after-school leading up to that game. <br> For kids who may not come from a stable home, this is a great way of gaining structure in their lives. <br> Teaching them that it is possible to have a structured life. 
<br>
<br>
He also mentions that, ‘football is the only sport that doesn’t exclude anyone.’ <br> High school teams want numbers, and they openly ask students to come and try out.<br> There is also no barrier to entry, schools support the sport so financial costs can be minimal compared to other sports, and athletic ability isn’t as big of an issue in high school football.
<br>
<br>
While I don’t necessarily have the resources to dispute his claims, he went to high school in Canada. <br> I have a feeling that if he were to go to high school, in let’s say, Texas. <br> He would be having a little bit of a different opinion. <br> Parents do spend a lot of money in football, a lot of gear and training, nutrition, is all required at the top level. 
<br>
<br>
However, his point overall was that you don’t need to or even desire to have a career in football to gain a lot out of it. <br> There, I can agree with him, however I believe that the dangers of the sport are just much too risky to go into the sport. <br> There are other avenues to explore as a high school student that can give you structure. <br> Clubs? Extracurriculars? Relationships with your teachers? More brainstorm is required, but I think he brings up a good point. </p>

	<br>
	<p class="page-wrap">I know I want to pivot from football. I’m honestly not too invested in that project. I don’t really know what to do, there are a lot of topics I can focus on but I’m not sure. I think I want to incorporate other people with this project. Not only does making all the art and designing the entire book and printing it sound like a daunting task, I think it takes away from my original intent. I want to create books, and design them. I also want to create art. I think it makes sense for me to have a small artistic part in my zine, and then have that filled around with other talented artists. I picked up this Loser zine at the end of the week, and I think that this is going to be the direction of the project.</p>

	<h3 class="page-wrap">Week 4 Documentation</h3>
	<br>
	<p class="page-wrap">- After finding the loser zine, I know I want to develop this idea further. I was thinking about doing an issue on family, or transition, I did free thinking brainstorming and just wrote down any subject that came to mind. family seemed to be the one I was gravitated towards most, so I wanted to focus on that. There’s a lot to explore with family, so I’m excited about this project. </p>
